# Documentation

This rule uses sambamba view to filter reads with a mapping quality lower
than a threshold. It also removes reads with multiple occurrence.

Required input:

- BAM file

Required output:

- The first output must be the expected output BAM file marked duplicates.
- (optional): although not required, you may specify the
  indexed BAM file in the output as a second argument,
  which is generated by the wrapper.

Log:

- two log files named out and err (see example)
