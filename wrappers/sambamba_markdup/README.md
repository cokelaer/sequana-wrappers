# Documentation

This rule marks or removes PCR duplicate reads. For determining whether a
read is a duplicate or not, the same criteria as in Picard are used.


Required input:

- BAM file

Required output:

- The first output must be the expected output BAM file marked duplicates.
- (optional): although not required, you may specify the
  indexed BAM file in the output as a second argument,
  which is generated by the wrapper.

Log:

- two log files named out and err (see example)

# Configuration

    sambamba_markdup:
        remove_duplicates: no # Remove or just mark duplicate reads.
        tmp_directory: /tmp # Temporary directory.
        options: 

# Example


    rule sambamba_markdup:
        input:
            "test.bam"
        output:
            bam="test.md.bam",
            bai="test.md.bam.bai"
        log:
            out = "log.out"
            err = "log.err"
        params:
            options="",
            tmp="tmp/"
            remove_duplicates=false
        wrapper:
            "main/wrappers/sambamba_markdup"

Note that the log section required 2 named arguments (out and err)
